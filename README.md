# Project: Slide in on Scroll

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

#### Project takeaways
* `debounce function` - A function that helps improve site performance by limiting how often a function is called such as on a `scroll` event. [https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function)
* `scrollY | innerHeight | offsetTop ` - Used to determine location of the image in the scroll window
